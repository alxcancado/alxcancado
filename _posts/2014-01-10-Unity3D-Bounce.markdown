description: Unity 3D + C# + Bouncing Ball. I really like the tutorials from Carlos Yanez in the Tuts+ network. Here I converted his Corona (LUA) tutorial to Unity and added some special effects in the buttons ;) This game is really easy to learn and hard to master, just got score 15 ;) If you want to look at the original Corona SDK tutorial just follow <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/coronasdk-create-an-entertaining-bouncing-game--mobile-20564" target=_blank>here</a>.

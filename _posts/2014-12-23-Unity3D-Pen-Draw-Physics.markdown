description: Unity3D + C# + Crayon + Physics. I'm exploring interesting game mechanics these days and what I've done here in Unity3D is similar to Crayon Physics awesome game. In this prototype you can draw in the scene, creating a new game object with physics so it's possible to interact with other game objects in the scene. (see the floor)
